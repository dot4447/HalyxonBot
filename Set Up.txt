Now, if you scroll down, you'll see a create bot user option. DO IT. click on reveal token DO NOT TELL YOUR TOKEN TO ANYONE. 
Next, on the top you'll see a client ID, copy this and search discord permissions calculator, this select the permissions you want you bot to have, paste your ID where it needs to and there'll be a link given to you, visit this link and you'll be able to add the bot on any server you have admin perms on.
If you want the bot to run only at certain times, remove the last three lines and replace the with -
client.run('yourtoken')
now press F5 and BOOM your bot's online to get it offline, close Python SHell(it open on its own when you run your bot)
When you want it oline for all the time, the xp system won't work unless you use a paid VPS since the free one I reccomend doesnt support json.(too bad lol)
Create a heroku account at their website, create a new app, open the deploy tab and connect it to this GitHub.
Open the setting tab and click on reveal config vars. This is where you use your bot's token, create a new var and name it TOKEN. paste yor token into its value and press deploy from the deploy tab.
